npm scripts:

npm run start / npm start : starts in dev mode --> localhost:8080
npm run build : generates production build below /build/
npm run deploy : deploys to github io under <user>.github.io/<project>
    Before this can work correctly, you should set publicName at webpack.config.js to match
    your project name on GitHub.
